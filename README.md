## Dashboard-Site

This is my personal portfolio website, built to showcase my projects, interests, and real-time integrations like Discord status. Built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. 

Features embedded YouTube videos that play using a modal player, also used Eggsy's [Lanyard API](https://lanyard.eggsy.xyz/) to show live Discord activity, and a contact form powered by [EmailJS](https://emailjs.com). Finally, GitHub Pages was used to host the site.
